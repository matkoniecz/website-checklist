Here is my subjective and tiny list of domain registrars that I encountered.

# Namesilo

9$/year, advertises itself as without hidden fees and renewal upcharges. They have both [why us](https://www.namesilo.com/why_us.php) and [price comparison](https://www.namesilo.com/pricing.php) pages that appear to be correct. I am currently customer of this company.

Also, they have [one-step configuration](https://www.namesilo.com/CustomDomain/Github) for domains used for websites hosted using Github pages.

Due to recommendations of http://www.registrarowl.com/ and https://fitsmallbusiness.com/best-domain-name-registrar/ I bought domain at https://www.namesilo.com/

So far I encountered no hidden fees and other problems.

Before paying it may be worth googling for coupon codes - it was easy to find one with 1$ price reduction.

# Google

should be fairly stable but I am not fan of supporting Google monopoly

https://domains.google.com/ looks nice but prices are noticeably higher, and I am trying to avoid doing everything with Google services.

# Hover

unclear price, deceptive company

https://www.hover.com/ is an excellent case of lying and deceptive company. Advertised price is 12.99$ (0.99 manipulation gets pass due to popularity of this scheme). On checkout first hidden fee appeared - tiny, but enough to try other service. It is quite sad because unlike GoDaddy site looked promising.

# GoDaddy

unclear price, horrible website, extreme upselling

Real price 50 times higher than advertised one. In this case method to hide it was to show 1 year cheaper, subsequent are extremely expensive. I noticed mention of minimum 2 year contract before running away. Though given how site looked and what I heard about this company I was not really surprised. https://godaddy.com/

Also - this company supported SOPA.
